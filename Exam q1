1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    
    public class Smartphone extends Technology{
    
      int number;
      
      public Smartphone(int number, String name){
      
         this.number = number;
         super(name);
      
      }
    
    }
    
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.

Inheritance is the abillity to create a class that is capable of using variables and methods from a superior class(parent class).

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  

public void speak(){

   System.out.println("My name is " + super(name) + ", and my number is " + this.number);

}

d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
Overriding
